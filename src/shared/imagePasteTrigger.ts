// a *fixed* Ctrl+V (codex-rs `fixed.paste_image = ctrl('v')`) and ignores an
// empty bracketed paste, so it needs Ctrl+V even on macOS; OpenCode accepts
// Ctrl+V on every OS too. Claude uses the OS-native signal — empty bracketed
// paste on macOS, Ctrl+V on Linux, and **Alt+V on Windows** (Claude Code binds
// image paste to Alt+V there; Ctrl+V is an ordinary paste and never reads the
// clipboard image — it just prints "No image found in clipboard. Use alt+v…").

 * — the Cmd+V image-forward path then no-ops. macOS Ctrl+V is unaffected: there
 * xterm emits \x16 natively and the host never sends a trigger. Detecting the
