# agent-session-index Specification
## Requirements

### Requirement: Read Claude Code sessions

The system SHALL enumerate Claude sessions from `<root>/projects/<encoded-cwd>/*.jsonl`, where `root` is `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set else `~/.claude`, and `encoded-cwd` is the project cwd with every `/` replaced by `-`. For each file the session id SHALL be the filename without the `.jsonl` extension, and the entry SHALL carry `cwd`, `gitBranch`, `permissionMode`, `model` (from the first assistant message's `message.model`), a `title` preview (from the first user message), and `modified` (the file's mtime).

### Requirement: Read Codex sessions

The system SHALL read Codex sessions from the `threads` table of `<codexDir>/state_5.sqlite` (columns `id, rollout_path, cwd, title, model, git_branch, approval_mode, sandbox_policy, reasoning_effort, first_user_message, updated_at_ms`) filtered `WHERE archived = 0` and ordered `updated_at_ms DESC`, where `codexDir` is `$CODEX_HOME` when set else `~/.codex`, and the SQLite file MAY be relocated to `$CODEX_SQLITE_HOME` when set. When the SQLite store is absent or unreadable, the system SHALL fall back to scanning `<codexDir>/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (reading the first line's `session_meta.payload.cwd`).

### Requirement: Read OpenCode sessions

The system SHALL read OpenCode sessions from the `session` table of `<dataDir>/opencode.db`, ordered `time_updated DESC`, mapping `session id = s.id`, `cwd = s.directory`, `title = s.title`, `modified = s.time_updated`, and deriving `model`/`agent` from the latest assistant `message` row for that session, where `dataDir` is `$XDG_DATA_HOME/opencode` when set else `~/.local/share/opencode` (the same location on every OS — OpenCode resolves it via the OS-agnostic `xdg-basedir`, NOT `%APPDATA%`). OpenCode has no fallback store; when the DB is absent, OpenCode contributes zero entries (not an error).

### Requirement: WAL-safe read-only SQLite access

For any SQLite-backed store, the system SHALL read a consistent snapshot without disturbing the live agent: snapshot the `.sqlite`/`.db` file plus its `-wal` and `-shm` sidecars (when present) into a temporary directory, query the snapshot in **read-only** mode, then delete the temporary directory. The system SHALL NOT query the live store in place (a read-only open of a live WAL store can return an empty result instead of an error, which is indistinguishable from a genuinely-empty session). To keep the snapshot cheap for large stores, the snapshot SHALL be created as a copy-on-write clone where the filesystem supports it (e.g. APFS/Btrfs reflink), falling back to a byte copy otherwise; both yield identical, independent snapshot semantics.

The system SHALL access SQLite preferring the built-in `node:sqlite` module (native row values), falling back to the host `sqlite3` binary in read-only JSON mode WHEN `node:sqlite` is unavailable — both without any new native dependency. (The `sqlite3 -json` formatter is pathologically slow for rows with large text/blob values, so it MUST NOT be the preferred engine where `node:sqlite` exists.) The SQLite read SHALL return a discriminated result distinguishing `ok` / `no-db` / `no-sqlite3` / `query-error` (not a bare empty array), so callers can tell "store absent" from "genuinely empty" from "tooling broken." WHEN neither SQLite engine is available, the read SHALL return `no-sqlite3` and SQLite-backed agents SHALL degrade to their fallback (Codex JSONL) or to zero entries (OpenCode) without raising an error; a `query-error` SHALL be counted as unreadable and surfaced, not silently dropped. Both engines SHALL query the temporary copy (never the live store); the `node:sqlite` engine SHALL be loaded inside a guard so an unsupported runtime degrades to `no-sqlite3` (then the CLI) rather than throwing.

### Requirement: Aggregate and sort sessions

The system SHALL merge entries from all enabled agents into a single list sorted by `modified` descending, each entry tagged with its agent `id`. Each entry id SHALL be namespaced by agent (e.g. `opencode:<sid>`) so ids never collide across agents.

### Requirement: Defensive, non-fatal parsing

The system SHALL skip any individual session entry that fails to parse without aborting the rest of the index, and SHALL report a count of unreadable entries. A missing store directory or file for an agent SHALL yield zero entries for that agent, never an error that breaks the aggregate list.

### Requirement: Metadata-only, bounded title preview, no egress

The system SHALL read session metadata (id, cwd, timestamp, model/flags) plus a single title preview. The
title preview is the ONLY transcript-derived value the system touches; because it originates from a user
message it MAY contain sensitive content, so it SHALL be truncated to ≤120 characters and newline-stripped
at read time. The bounded metadata and title preview MAY be cached on the local machine to accelerate
display, provided the cache is written owner-only (file mode `0o600`) under the extension's storage and is
NEVER transmitted off the machine. The system SHALL NOT read message bodies beyond the first preview line,
SHALL NOT persist or cache any transcript content beyond the bounded title preview, and SHALL NOT send any
vault data off the machine.

#### Scenario: Only a bounded preview leaves the reader

- **WHEN** a session file contains full conversation message content
- **THEN** only the listed metadata fields plus one ≤120-char, newline-stripped title preview are extracted;
  no further message body is stored, cached, or sent over IPC

### Requirement: Surface workflow sub-agents

The system SHALL discover `/workflow` runs for a Claude session and surface each run as ONE nested group child in that session's detail timeline. Workflow run manifests live at `<projects>/<dir>/<parentId>/workflows/<wfId>.json` and the per-agent transcripts at `<projects>/<dir>/<parentId>/subagents/workflows/<wfId>/agent-*.jsonl` (each `isSidechain:true`). The group node's label SHALL come from the manifest (`workflowName`, `agentCount`, `status`) — NOT from the agents' `.meta.json`, which carries only `{agentType:"workflow-subagent"}`. Expanding the group SHALL render a manifest-backed `workflowBoard` built from the manifest's `workflowProgress` (phases + per-agent rows), and selecting an agent SHALL lazy-load that agent's transcript by its `:wfagent:` id. WHERE the manifest has no usable `workflowProgress` (absent, empty, or carrying no `workflow_agent` entries), the group SHALL fall back to listing its agents by first prompt (bounded). Because the parent's `Workflow` tool call carries no run id, group placement SHALL use the manifest's start time. A workflow agent is one-shot (no back-and-forth) and SHALL render as a single node, not segmented.

The entry-id contract for workflow children is: group `claude:<parentId>:workflow:<wfId>`, agent leaf `claude:<parentId>:wfagent:<wfId>:<stem>`. `<wfId>` SHALL match `wf_[A-Za-z0-9_-]+` and `<stem>` SHALL match `agent-[A-Za-z0-9]+`; the resolved transcript path SHALL be containment-checked under the Claude projects root (traversal rejected), never trusting any webview-supplied path.

### Requirement: Thread team-member turns into the leader timeline

A Claude session file whose first record carries BOTH a non-empty `agentName` and a non-empty `teamName` SHALL be treated as a non-lead team member (the exclusion predicate MUST match the grouping predicate, so an `agentName`-only session is never hidden). The system SHALL EXCLUDE non-lead members from the aggregated top-level session list — without counting them toward the unreadable tally (a skip is not a parse failure). The leader is the session that records that `teamName`; because the team episode may sit anywhere in a large transcript, the leader's `teamName`s SHALL be collected across the FULL streamed transcript (not only the bounded head+tail window). The live team config at `~/.claude/teams/<teamName>/config.json` MUST NOT be relied upon for linkage (it is deleted on teardown); the durable in-file `teamName`/`agentName` fields are the source of truth.

Instead of one collapsed group node, the system SHALL surface each member as a sequence of per-turn nodes threaded into the leader's detail timeline. A member's transcript is a sequence of turns; each turn begins at a `user` record whose text is `<teammate-message teammate_id="X">` (the incoming message) and runs until the next such record (or end of file). For each turn the system SHALL emit one `teammateTurn` timeline item carrying: the member's `agentName`, a `color` (from the leader file's `<teammate-message teammate_id color>` record for that member, else a fixed palette by index), the sender `from` (`"leader"` when `X` is `team-lead`, otherwise the peer member name), a bounded message preview, a `timestamp`, and the segment entry-id. Turns SHALL be merged into the leader's timeline by `timestamp`. Member-to-member (peer) messages SHALL be included, discovered by scanning each member file (a turn boundary whose `teammate_id` is not `team-lead` is a peer message); each message is recorded once in its recipient's file, so no turn is double-counted. Team-member discovery SHALL be scoped to the leader's own project directory and skipped entirely when the leader records no `teamName`.

#### Scenario: A teammate is threaded, not listed top-level

- **WHEN** a session file's first record has both an `agentName` and a `teamName` (a non-lead team member)
- **THEN** it does not appear in the top-level list (and is not counted unreadable), and each of its communication turns appears as a color-highlighted `teammateTurn` node — labelled with the member name and sender (leader or peer) — interleaved by time in the detail of the leader that recorded the same `teamName`

### Requirement: Open a single teammate turn

The system SHALL resolve a view-only segment id `claude:<memberId>:turn:<n>` to a detail containing ONLY the records of the n-th turn of that member's transcript (from the n-th incoming `<teammate-message>` boundary up to the next boundary, or end of file) — i.e. from receiving the request through the member's response. `<memberId>` SHALL satisfy the existing session-id safety check and `<n>` SHALL be a non-negative integer; the member transcript SHALL be located under the Claude projects root with the existing containment check, never trusting a webview-supplied path or record range. An out-of-range `<n>` or unsafe id SHALL resolve to null. The id is view-only (it contains `:` and therefore is rejected by the launch entry resolver); the member session itself remains independently launchable by its plain `claude:<memberId>`.

### Requirement: Nested and teammate nodes are always visible and visually distinct

When the detail view renders a session's timeline, a nested node — a one-shot subagent, a workflow group, or a `teammateTurn` — SHALL be rendered directly and SHALL NOT be hidden behind the per-run "Show N more steps" step-collapse, regardless of how many ordinary steps surround it (it breaks the run). Runs of ordinary assistant/thinking/tool steps MAY remain capped, at no more than THREE items before "Show N more". A `teammateTurn` node SHALL be visually distinct from ordinary transcript steps using an explicit accent (a colored bar/dot keyed to the member `color`) and MUST NOT rely on a subtle theme border that can resolve to near-invisible under a real color theme.

#### Scenario: A teammate turn deep in a long run is still visible and highlighted

- **WHEN** a `teammateTurn` node sits among more than three non-user timeline items (e.g. between many tool steps with no intervening user message)
- **THEN** it renders directly with its color accent and message preview, while the ordinary steps on either side stay independently capped at three behind "Show N more"
