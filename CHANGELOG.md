# Changelog

All notable changes to **AnyWhere Terminal** are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-11

### Removed

- Plain-click cursor positioning (added in 0.6.1) is removed. The custom hijack handler emitted arrow-key escape sequences whenever the user clicked, which leaked raw `^[[D` / `^[[C` characters into the terminal whenever the shell was not at a readline prompt — most reproducibly during shell startup, after switching panel tabs, in the middle of long-running commands, and on multi-line input. Without shell integration (OSC 133/633) there is no reliable signal for "shell is at a prompt", so the heuristic guards (idle window, first-input gate, wrapped-input range) could not close every case. `Alt+Click` (Option+Click on macOS) continues to move the cursor via xterm.js's built-in `altClickMovesCursor` default.

## [0.6.2] — 2026-05-11

### Changed

- Updated marketplace description and keywords for clearer discovery (mentions split panes, tabs, theming, WebGL, Cursor).

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-10

### Added

- Click cursor positioning in the terminal pane (`ClickCursorHandler`) — click in the terminal to move the shell cursor. (Removed in 0.8.0 — see entry above.)

## [0.6.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added

- Cursor IDE integration — the extension now installs and runs against Cursor 3.2.21+ (VS Code 1.105.1 baseline). Includes host-compatibility spec and discovery docs.
- Asimov core skill set, MCP server configurations, and updated environment settings (preceding commit, shipped together with 0.6.0).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

- Bundled `asm` binary for build/test tooling.

### Changed

- Tab bar layout is now responsive — tabs collapse and overflow gracefully on narrow views.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added

- Confirmation prompt before opening URLs from terminal output.

### Fixed

- `Cmd+Click` on URLs now opens links in the default browser instead of inside the editor.
- `Shift+Enter` and macOS line/word navigation keys (`Cmd+←/→`, `Option+←/→`, `Cmd+Backspace`) are intercepted correctly and forwarded to the shell.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-03-22

Release-only bump — same code as 0.3.1.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-03-09 → 2026-03-20

### Added

- Insert file path into the terminal via the Explorer right-click menu, plus `Shift+drag` from the Explorer.
- `Cmd+Backspace` (macOS) / `Ctrl+Backspace` shortcut to kill the input line (sends `Ctrl+U`).

### Changed

- Major refactor of the webview terminal:
  - Extracted `TerminalFactory`, split renderer, and flow control into dedicated modules.
  - Extracted `WebviewStateStore`, `ResizeCoordinator`, `MessageRouter` from `main.ts`.
  - Extracted `ThemeManager`, `BannerService`, `XtermFitService` from `main.ts`.
- Introduced skill locking and comprehensive webview terminal refactoring documentation.

### Fixed

- Acknowledgement routing for backpressure messages.
- Resize timer leaks on rapid pane changes.
- Render service guard for disposed panes.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added

- Extension settings: `shell.macOS`, `shell.args`, `scrollback`, `fontSize`, `fontFamily`, `cursorBlink`, `defaultCwd`.
- Advanced theme integration that follows VS Code dark / light / high-contrast themes.
- Performance optimization pass: adaptive output buffering, WebGL hardening, overflow protection, per-session memory tracking.
- Right-click context menu inside terminal panes (clear, kill, new, split, close) and Escape key handling.
- Enhanced terminal status feedback and error handling — visible status banners on failure.

### Changed

- Improved context menu command targeting and terminal fitting; removed unused native clipboard commands.

## [0.2.5] — 2026-03-04 → 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Bottom Panel terminal view** — drop-in replacement for the built-in panel terminal.
- **Editor Terminal** — open a terminal as an editor tab via `WebviewPanel`.
- **Session Manager** — central registry coordinating sessions across Sidebar / Panel / Editor.
- **Multi-tab UI** — tab bar, switching, and keyboard shortcuts for multiple sessions per view.
- **Secondary Sidebar** support — move the terminal to the right pane via the command palette.
- **Split panes** — binary split tree, split container UI, drag-to-resize handles, recursive splitting.
- Split commands, keybindings (`Cmd+\`, `Cmd+Shift+\`), and pane focus management.
- Last-pane-close handling and visible separator between split panes.
- View-specific commands for Sidebar vs. Panel (tab bar buttons).
- Context menu actions on split panes: close, split vertical, split horizontal.
- Dynamic terminal location inference and theme application based on host view.
- View lifecycle resilience: terminals survive view collapse/show cycles.

### Changed

- Hide xterm.js native scrollbar in favor of VS Code's scrollbar styling.
- Refined deployment scripts.

### Fixed

- Ghost tabs caused by stale UUIDs after pane close.
- Wrong split-button icons in the title bar.
- Invalid tab restoration on view re-mount.

## [0.2.4] — 2026-03-04

### Changed

- General UI polish across the sidebar webview.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-04

Release-only bump (git tag `v0.2.1`).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-04

Release-only bump (git tag `v0.2.0`).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-03-04

### Added

- WebGL addon for xterm.js — GPU-accelerated rendering, smooth on Retina displays.
- Deployment scripts (`deploy`, `deploy:vsce`, `deploy:ovsx`, `deploy:patch`, `deploy:minor`).

### Fixed

- Double-input issue caused by duplicate keystroke listeners.

### Changed

- Disabled Biome's `useNamingConvention` lint rule for a more flexible naming style.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-03-03 → 2026-03-04

Initial scaffold — never published, but the foundation for everything that followed.

### Added

- Webview-hosted xterm.js terminal in the **Primary Sidebar** via Activity Bar entry.
- PTY integration through `node-pty` with `PtyManager` and `PtySession` for dynamic process management.
- IPC layer between extension host and webview with output buffering and flow control.
- Clipboard support (`Cmd+C` / `Cmd+V`).
- Project scaffolding: TypeScript, esbuild bundling, Biome linting, Vitest unit tests, VS Code integration tests.
- Initial design and planning documentation.
